## v1.2.0 | 2025-08-12

> Started development: 2025-08-10  
> Released: 2025-08-12

Introduction of full Meadow integration; First release to Steam Workshop. Released `1d 16h 21min` after `v1.1.0`.

* Reworked previous Meadow-compatibility systems into a full integration with the mod's own methods and behaviors.
* Added sync of player and host REMIX options.
* Added proper sync of creature revival. Visual effects are still not synced, though.
* Added Rain Meadow as a soft dependency.
* Marked this mod as "High Impact" for Rain Meadow. This means both host and player have the mod enabled/disabled to play together.
  * If the player doesn't have the mod enabled but the host does, the player will be requested to enable it, and vice-versa.
* Added in-house logger, which logs all mod events to a separate file (see [#1]) and the game's own logs.
* Added `mod` folder with the mod's compiled files.
* Fixed iterator revival not working (since v1.1.0)
* Fixed REMIX options being rendered increasingly lower over time (since v1.1.0)
* Fixed online players not being able to be revived. (since v1.1.0)

Known introduced issues:

* Joining a Meadow lobby as a client (non-host) causes the game to freeze.
* Host-client options sync is overriden by the client right after receiving the host's own settings, invalidating the sync entirely.

## v1.1.1 | Unreleased[^norelease]

> Started development: 2025-08-09  
> Released: None

First partially Meadow-compatible version. Not ever released.

* Introduced Meadow-specific compatibility layer.
* Introduced system for hooking specific classes to the game, depending on whether Rain Meadow was enabled.
  * The Meadow-specific classes are either wrappers for their vanilla counterparts, or modified copies using both modded types (e.g. `OnlineCreature`) and vanilla ones (e.g. `Creature`).
* Added hacky methods to revive creatures based on their `OnlineCreature` variant. This was never actually tested in practice.
* Fixed self-ascension not working since the previous version.

## v1.1.0 | Unreleased[^norelease]

> Started development: 2025-08-08  
> Released: 2025-08-09

First content update. Released `21h 30min` after the first release.

* Added ability to revive dead creatures, including iterators.
* Revival has its own effects, and briefly debilitates both player and creature.
* Added REMIX options for toggling the mod's features.
* Initialized GitHub repository.

Known introduced bugs:

* Player cannot ascend themselves anymore.
* At some point, iterator revival is also broken.
* Rain Meadow compatibility is implicit and requires both host and player to have the mod. Related bugs are:
  * If the host does not have this mod, creatures cannot be revived at all.
  * Other players cannot be revived.
  * Option `Require Karma Flower` may cause clients to have invisible Karma Flowers, which can be eaten but not used for reviving creatures.
* REMIX options are rendered lower than before every time the player opens the mod's menu.

## v1.0.0 | Unreleased[^nocode]

Ascended Saint allows Saint to target themselves with their Ascension ability, as well as "de-ascending" (or reviving) dead creatures (and iterators!) with a Karma Flower in hands.

Self-ascension, de-ascension and Karma Flower requirements can all be individually toggled in the mod's REMIX options menu.

Ascended Saint was released on August 12th, 2025. Its latest official version is `1.2.3` (release) or `1.3.0` (dev/unstable).

## ControlLib

ControlLib allows the "possession" of almost any creature, using Safari controls and a custom Possession API for handling of player "possessions". As of writing, Overseers and other players are the only non-possessable creatures.

A variety of settings, including Rain Meadow compatibility, control modes, and cheat options are individually toggle-able in the mod's REMIX options menu.

This mod is not yet released. Its latest official version is `0.3.1` (dev/unstable).

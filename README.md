**Ascended Saint** is a Rain World mod which allows the player to target themselves with Saint's Attunement/Ascension ability. Why? I'm not really sure, someone once suggested that and I made it a reality, yet a bunch of people seemed really happy to "ascend themselves" with it.

The latest version of the mod (as of 2026-02-01) is `v2.0.0`; Its target game version is `v1.11.5`, i.e. the latest version available.

## Features (as of v2.0.0)

- Ascend thyself! Saint is now vulnerable to their own ascension ability. Toggleable with a REMIX option.
- "De-ascend" (aka revive) other creatures, players and iterators included! Requires a Karma Flower by default (per revived target). Both are toggleable with a REMIX option.
  - We are not responsible for loss of trust, friendship or body parts caused by a misuse of karmic powers. You have been warned.
- Contains full (not yet) support for Rain Meadow! Ascend your friends, return them, ascend them again...
- A complete lack of redeeming qualities! Think Saint couldn't get more insufferable as a character in multiplayer? Think again.

## Planned Features

- Healer Saint! Perhaps *one* redeeming quality wouldn't hurt too badly, would it? In essence, a Saint who can only heal/revive creatures with their Ascension ability. Finally, an actual Saint and not a megalomaniac with a furry face.

## How to Install

Either subscribe to it in the Steam Workshop (link above), or download and unzip the latest release to `Rain World/RainWorld_Data/StreamingAssets/mods/`.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome, and they're far easier to account for than comments on the Workshop page (in other words, easier to remember, easier to fix). Anyone is entirely free to do anything they want with this code, so if I ever disappear and cease to update this mod, I grant all permissions to anyone willing to port this to a later update (not like it's a complex or game-changing mod though lol).

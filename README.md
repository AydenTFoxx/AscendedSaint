**Ascended Saint** is a Rain World mod which allows the player to target themselves with Saint's Attunement/Ascension ability. Why? I'm not really sure, someone once suggested that and I made it a reality, yet a bunch of people seemed really happy to "ascend themselves" with it.

The latest version of the mod (as of 2026-02-05) is `v2.0.2`; Its target game version is `v1.11.6`, i.e. the latest version available.

## Features (as of v2.0.0)

- Ascend thyself! Saint is now vulnerable to their own ascension ability. Toggleable with a REMIX option.
- "De-ascend" (aka revive) other creatures, players and iterators included! Requires a Karma Flower by default (per revived target). Both are toggleable with a REMIX option.
  - We are not responsible for loss of trust, friendship or body parts caused by a misuse of karmic powers. You have been warned.
- Healer Saint! Trade away your ascension powers for the ability to mend any wound and cure even death itself. Toggleable and compatible with ascension-related REMIX options.
- Contains full (not yet) support for Rain Meadow! Ascend your friends, return them, ascend them again...
- A complete lack of redeeming qualities! Think Saint couldn't get more insufferable as a character in multiplayer? Think again.

## Planned Features

- Healer Saint needs something better for singleplayer than a mere cure. Charm mechanics, perhaps?

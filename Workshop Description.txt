    [*] [i]Have you ever wondered, "why does Saint's ability affect anyone but themselves?"[/i]
    [*] [i]Have you ever thought, "is there such a thing as de-ascension?"[/i]
    [*] [i]Have you ever sought to speedrun [strike]death[/strike] ascension as quickly as possible?[/i]

Then look no further, for I present you...

[h2] Ascended Saint [/h2]

No longer shall Saint be excluded from the consequences of their actions. This mod fixes the cosmic imbalances in Rain World's universe by allowing Saint to be targeted by their own Ascension ability.

Leaving existence behind has never been as easy. Simply activate your ascension ability, point in slugcat's general direction, and leave behind once and for all this world of endless blizzards and insta-killing lizards.

[h2] Reviving Creatures [/h2]

Lost a creature but doesn't want to allow it to leave the Cycle for good? Now you can bring it back by [strike]sheer force[/strike] the power of [b]de-ascension[/b]!

For starters, have a body you wish to revive, and a Karma Flower. This shall be our channel to commune with higher planes, and [strike]snatch away[/strike] call back upon our lost creature.

Simply use Saint's ability on a corpse (while holding the Karma Flower) to bring it back to life!

Do mind though Rain World creatures are not the most grateful beings, and will still have the same opinion on you as from before they got killed!

[h3] Note this also works for... unusual beings as well. Have fun ;) [/h3]

[h2] REMIX Options [/h2]

Don't wanna accidentally ascend yourself while bringing peace to this world? Think "limitless revival" is too powerful of an ability for your tastes? Want revived creatures to still face the consequences of post-death? We got you covered!

All of these features can be individually toggled on, off, or modified as you wish on the mod's REMIX menu.

[h2] Meadow Support? Yessir! [/h2]

Ascended Saint was made with [i]Rain Meadow[/i] support in mind, and offers compatibility out of the box for both Story and Arena modes of the mod.

One caveat, however, is that all players must have this mod enabled, or they will not be able to join the lobby at all. This is a feature of Rain Meadow, not a limitation of this mod.
